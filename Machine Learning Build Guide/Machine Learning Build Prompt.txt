InfographicApp Prompt

Generate an HTML app with JavaScript (no REACT) that provides actionable and clickable guide for "Machine Learning Build Guide" to 
resources for code snippets, tutorials, descriptions, illustrations for each of these concepts from the graphics 
attached in the prompt. Assume Intermediate level. Assume vibrant and colorful style. Optimize for programmic interation. 
Include information and examples in Python, SQL, R, and JavaScript. Use a clickable tile for each concept and each 
should have a clickable checkmark that I can use to mark the concept as complete. 
On each tile put the links to resources, descriptions, and action steps. Use the the system layer flowchart, common algorithms, workflow, and popular models that will lead a users from a prompt to building a Machine Learning app. 
Multiple tabs: Define Problem (Allows the user to define functions and contraints with a prompt), A tab for each step in the workflow, a tab for auto generating
the workflow using either Quen, ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini (Combo box) to generate the output. If any of the stages have actionable things to do, those things should
be seen on the tab. Include any hyperlinked resources and examples. Add a last tab "Reference" that has each graphic in a table as tiles. Clicking a tile, cause the graphic 
to open in a pop up window. Below that should be this prompt.
Before generating app, ask interactive questions, one-at-a-time, waiting for answers, to improve the quality of the
app and make suggestions for improvement.
